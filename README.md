# COMP30027-ML-A2
Kaggle competition of book rating prediction

# Important
University of Melbourne COMP30027 Machine Learning project 2. This is only a demonstration of using various models in predicting labels of a dataset, and the result is used for a Kaggle course competition [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/comp30027-2023). External use of the code is strictly prohibited as it's a university project and if any causes, acedemic integrity may be againsted.

# Result
The Result is eventually in top 50 of the course. Besides all the normal models from the sklearn, AutoGluon is used as well but since working on a CPU, results not optimized (proved by other group to have a higher accuracy if correctly implemented and the use of AutoGluon can push the rank to top 3 of the leaderboard).
